/* Bias range check.
 *
 * The circuit behaviour has only been characterised with ibias1_250n at
 * -250 nA and ibias2_1 at -1 uA;  away from those the output below means
 * nothing, so a testbench that quietly supplies something else is
 * measuring a number the model is not entitled to produce.
 *
 * The check is a flag rather than a clamp or an error.  Clamping would
 * hide a misconnection, and $error would stop a run that may be
 * deliberately sweeping the trim.  bias_ok is readable from a testbench
 * (cocotb reads it directly), and the warning fires only while the
 * block is enabled, because an unbiased disabled bandgap is normal.
 *
 * NaN fails the check, which is intended:  every comparison against NaN
 * is false, so an unconnected bias reads as out of range rather than as
 * a pass.

/* Circuit behaviour:  the trim curve, straight from simulation.
 *
 * The trim is a 16-bit thermometer code, so the only thing that matters
 * is how many bits are set --- j, from 0 to 16.  That is seventeen
 * possible outputs, and all seventeen have been simulated, so this is a
 * lookup rather than a fit:  there is no interpolation to do and no
 * approximation error to carry.  Replace the numbers when the block is
 * re-characterised;  nothing else here needs to change.
 *
 * Characterised 2026-09-21, after the trim resistor chain was changed
 * from "rhigh" to "rppd".  With rhigh the trim covered a far wider
 * range than needed AND sat badly off-centre;  with rppd, and no other
 * change, the curve lands on the flattest part of the tempco at
 * EXACTLY half trim.  So j = 8 -> 1.231 V is the nominal setting, and
 * it is the middle of the code range rather than an arbitrary point.
 *
 * Shape:  asymptotically straight at high trim, rolling off at low
 * trim.  If a closed form is ever wanted in preference to the table,
 *     quadratic  1.18266 + 0.00497239*j + 0.000131321*j^2   (max 1.3 mV)
 *     linear     1.17741 + 0.00707353*j                     (max 6.6 mV)
 * The linear residuals are a systematic arch, worst at both endpoints
 * and +3 mV at half trim, which is the one place accuracy is wanted;
 * that is what the roll-off costs a straight line.
 *
 * NOTE this is a single-corner, single-temperature model.  The whole
 * point of the trim is tempco, and there is no temperature input here,
 * so these are nominal values only.
